## Getting Started

This template can be used in the following two ways: 
- **Using with the GitHub Pages Service.** GitHub will provide you with a server to generate and host web pages.
- **Using locally with Jekyll.** You may install Jekyll on your own computer and generate static web pages (i.e., HTML files) with this template. After that, you may upload the HTML files to your server.

The detailed instructions are available below.
