## TODOs if you are using this template

1. Update the name, contact information, biography, publications, and experiences with your own details.
2. Remove `CNAME` file or update it with your own domain name.
3. (Optional) Cite this repository on your homepage to help spread the word ;) You can find a template reference at the end of `index.html`.

## FAQs

1. How to unfold the collapsed *Education* and *Experience* sections?
   - If you want to disable the collapsing feature entirely, remove the corresponding `<div>` tags in `index.html`. You can find them by searching for `<!-- Collapse -->`.
   - If you want to keep the collapsing feature but want to show the sections by default, you can replace `<div class="collapse" id="more-content">` with `<div class="show" id="more-content">` in `index.html`. I made a template there for your convenience - just uncomment it.
